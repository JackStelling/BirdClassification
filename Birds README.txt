Hi there,

You'll probably want to investigate the Xception python script as this one contains 
the best accuracy and the one which I've quoted in the final report. 

I've included the VGG code as this is where I explain in detail a lot of the 
hyperparameter tuning step that were carried out and the reasons behind them. 
It also includes code for the initial file strucutre set-up.

Inside the ModelWeights folder I've included the best model weights for both VGG and Xception, 
the code contains the steps to load these in. Due to continuous modifications the code documents 
won't run from top bottom as I often returned to code above and made some tweaks and re ran cells. 
Explaination of these steps is contained within all code documents.To make predictions you will 
also need the labels list provided in the 'label_list.pkl' document. 


Enjoy,
Jack.
